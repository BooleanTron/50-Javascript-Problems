# Problem 15: Create Debounce and Throttle Utilities

## Objectives

- **Understand function control**  
  Learn how to manage the rate at which a function is executed in JavaScript, especially when dealing with events like `scroll`, `resize`, `input`, or `keypress`.

- **Implement Debounce**  
  - Ensure a function runs **only after a specified delay** has passed since the last invocation.  
  - Prevent unnecessary or frequent calls in rapid-fire event scenarios (e.g., search bar input).

- **Implement Throttle**  
  - Ensure a function runs at most **once in a given interval**, regardless of how many times itâ€™s triggered.  
  - Maintain performance and responsiveness in high-frequency event triggers (e.g., window resize, scroll).

- **Compare and contrast**  
  - Differentiate between debounce (delays execution) and throttle (limits execution frequency).  
  - Recognize use cases where each is more appropriate.

- **Write reusable utility functions**  
  Create clean, reusable debounce and throttle utilities that can be applied to multiple scenarios in real-world JavaScript projects.
