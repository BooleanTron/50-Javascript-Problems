# 🧠 JavaScript Mastery — 50 Juicy Problems

Welcome to my **JavaScript Mastery** repo!  
This project is designed to **solidify my understanding of JavaScript** by solving **50 carefully curated problems and mini-projects**. Each task is designed to test and stretch my knowledge in different areas of the language — from the basics to DOM manipulation, async operations, and real-world logic.

> 💻 **Platform:** 100% GitHub Codespaces ready  
> 🛠️ **Goal:** Build a strong JavaScript baseline  
> 📅 **Target:** Solve all 50 problems as daily or weekly challenges
